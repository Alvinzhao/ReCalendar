# Changes for having a central db api

* Do no expose internal objects (mutable or immutable), use copy-in copy-out api.

* Move persistence control into the model (or a wrapper class)

* Update views using listener on-change callback.

* Use thread syncronization.

* Handle gracefully asynchronous model changes

* Model should reject duplicate item ids

* Whenever possible, use item is as key (instead of index)
